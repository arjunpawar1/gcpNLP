it is better than anything I used before.
So good that I am going to buy one for my brother.
response is so quick and snappy.
it broke the second day.
dont' use it.
just average compared to all other controller I used.
one key broke off after 3 months.
good value for the price.
too expensive for a simple controller.
it does not work with my xbox.
works like a champ on PS4.
the sharp of the handle is not very comfortable.
Is there a black color one. the white color gets dirty quickly.
so addited to use this controller playing my game compared to other ones.
Very fine product!
Fantastic!
No one better!
